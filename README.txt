How long did you spend on your solution? 
	I've spent about 7 hours implementing everything even I was aware of the 3 hours suggested, I took it as a challenge and wanted to complete it regardless the time spent on it.
	I considered several options before coding the project but at the end I decided to implement an external WEB API which to me makes a clearer separation between presentation and logic
	I had to deal with CORS issues which took me longer than expected to solve 
	
How do you build and run your solution? 
    With visual studio, you have to run the API project to make the WEB API up and then being placed inside of the project folder ClientAPP execute a command bash: ng serve
    This will launnch the web project at port 4200
   
What assumptions did you make when implementing your solution? 
    I wanted a clear separation between presentation and logic and also have an user friendly app, which I think it is. 
    I choose angular 6 as front end framework since I have been workking recently a lot with angularJS and wanted to try something new.
	
Why did you pick the design that you did?
    I tried to inspire in the Kanban pages you can find everywhere, with 2 panels and different stickers that you can add or move
  
If you were unable to complete any user stories, outline why and how would you have liked to implement them
    I completed the three user stories, but for a future implementation, I would have considered features like remove items or drag and drop and some way of storing the data created and different users and roles
